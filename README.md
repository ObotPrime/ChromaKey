### About
A side-scrolling platformer game made for my 10th grade programming class. It is heavily inspired by early Nintendo Entertainment System games, with 8-Bit style sprite art and music composed to replicate the 2A03 sound chip.

### How to play:
 - Arrow keys to move
 - Space to jump
 - Jump on enemies to defeat them
 - Collect coins and defeat enemies for score
 - Don't die!
